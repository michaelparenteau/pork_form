pork_form
=========

Form Behavior Plugin that is easy use and customize created by [Joseph Payton](http://josephpayton.com) &amp; [Michael Parenteau](http://michaelparenteau.com). We got together on a Friday to create something that we could concurrently work on, give to the community... and also use ourselves! Hopefully this develops into many form behaviors, styles, and beautiful form designs... because Web Apps Love Forms!

## How?

### pork_form consists of:

  * Add class="pork_form" on the form you want to add the behaviors to.
  * pork_form.css
  * Jquery 1.4.2 &amp; pork_form.js

## Why Pork?
**Because pork is tasty!**  
Forms are... well, just forms. We wanted to make forms cool and also beautiful!
